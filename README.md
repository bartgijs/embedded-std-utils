# Embedded STD utils
My implementation of the std utils that are not available on the Arduino platform by default.
I use these implementations in my other Arduino classes to provide a (probably) simpler version of the extensive std support.

This allows me to learn from implementing the solutions about how it is implemented in the official version, and it allows me to use these features in an Arduino environment.
